<br>Supports <marker>extension functions</marker> and <marker>extension properties</marker> .
<br>If a <marker>class has a member function</marker> , and an extension function is defined which has the same receiver type, the same name is applicable to given arguments, the <marker>member always wins</marker> .
<br>However, it's perfectly OK for extension functions to overload member functions which have the same name but a different signature.
<br>The <terminal>this</terminal> keyword inside an extension function corresponds to the receiver object (the one that is passed before the dot).
