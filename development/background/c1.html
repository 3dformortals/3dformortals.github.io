<year>2020</year> Development process of mobile game, can be comfort using desktop pc up to polishing/testing stage, which anyways need that mobile device was used.
<br> After general development stuff complete, and game will work as expected on desktop pc, there is big chance that weak mobile devices will have huge lags, because not strong hardware etc.
<br> Massive background can be the reason of lags. Lot of cases this situation can be fixed, less or more, enough to remove lags , without loose the background quality.

<br><br>Next recommendation can help make background more lightweight for rendering on screen , and keep the background quality close to original.

<hr>
Single layered textures(png files etc) on screen.

<br><br>If screen(game level) have few static single layered textures, which should be rendered in same time, as logical group etc, as possible , these textures should be joined in one texture atlas, and texture atlas should be single page as possible(this maximize the performance).
<br>F.e. for case of <marker>img1.png</marker> and <marker>img2.png</marker> files:
<ul class="steps">
    <li>
        strictly using of files from file system will have next steps:
        <ul>
            <li>once load files into memory as textures</li>
            <li>every render loop will be next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to <marker>img1.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img1.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>switch to <marker>img2.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img2.png</marker> texture</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        using of texture atlas created using same files:
        <ul>
            <li>once load atlas on initialization</li>
            <li>every render loop will be next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to atlas texture(altas is single page, and will only one switch)</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img1.png</marker> texture from atlas as atlas texture region</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img2.png</marker> texture from atlas as atlas texture region</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
Every additional switch texture step is enough high coast, and get cpu sources , finally increase time of rendering.
Every additional switch of texture atlas pages is enough high coast, but less coast, if atlas page include few rendered texture regions from logical grouped textures, f.e. level1 , level2 etc.

<hr>
Vertical layered stack of textures(png files etc) on screen. Similar as multilayered picture.
<br>Can be used f.e. for easy coloring of textures on the fly, or for change some "layers" colors, as in case of Bangladesh
and Japan flag
