<year>2020</year> Development process of mobile game, can be comfort using desktop pc up to polishing/testing stage, which anyways need that mobile device was used.
<br> After general development stuff complete, and game will work as expected on desktop pc, there is big chance that weak mobile devices will have huge lags, because not strong hardware etc.
<br> Massive background can be the reason of lags. Lot of cases this situation can be fixed, less or more, enough to remove lags , without loose the background quality.

<br><br>Next recommendation can help make background more lightweight for rendering on screen , and keep the background quality close to original.

<hr>
Single layered textures(png files etc) on screen.

<br><br>If screen(game level) have few static single layered textures, which should be rendered in same time, as logical group etc, as possible , these textures should be joined in one texture atlas, and texture atlas should be single page as possible(this maximize the performance).
<br>F.e. for case of <marker>img1.png</marker> and <marker>img2.png</marker> files:
<ul class="steps">
    <li>
        strictly using of files from file system will have next steps:
        <ul>
            <li>once loaded files into memory as textures</li>
            <li>every render loop will have next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to <marker>img1.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img1.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>switch to <marker>img2.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img2.png</marker> texture</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        using of texture atlas created using same files:
        <ul>
            <li>once loaded texture atlas on initialization</li>
            <li>every render loop will have next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to atlas texture(altas is single page, and will only one switch)</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img1.png</marker> texture from atlas as atlas texture region</li>
                    <li>render <marker>img2.png</marker> texture from atlas as atlas texture region</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
Every additional switch texture step is enough high coast, and get cpu sources , finally increase time of rendering.
Every additional switch of texture atlas pages is enough high coast, but less coast, if atlas page include few rendered texture regions from logical grouped textures, f.e. level1 , level2 etc.

<hr>
Vertical layered stack of textures(png files etc) on screen. Similar as multilayered picture.
<br>Can be used f.e. for easy coloring of textures on the fly, or for change some "layers" colors, as in case of

Bangladesh flag
<img class="h200px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Flag_of_Bangladesh.svg"></img>

and Japan flag implementation, before render to screen.
<img class="svgh200px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg"></img>

In case of flags, can be enough two files <marker>round.png</marker> (with transparent area) and <marker>rectangle.png</marker> , both of white pixels which later can be colored.

<br><br>If screen have vertical layered stack of textures, which should be rendered in same time, as logical group etc, as possible , final(which include all prependered "layers") texture should be prepared using <marker>fbo / Frame Buffer Object / texture buffering</marker> (this maximize the performance).

<br>F.e. for case of <marker>round.png</marker> and <marker>rectangle.png</marker> files:

<ul class="steps">
    <li>strictly using of files from file system will have next steps:
        <ul>
            <li>once loaded files into memory as textures</li>
            <li>every render loop will have next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to <marker>rectangle.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>render <marker>rectangle.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>switch to <marker>round.png</marker> texture</li>
                    <li>render <marker>round.png</marker> texture</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>using of texture atlas created using same files:
        <ul>
            <li>once loaded texture atlas on initialization</li>
            <li>every render loop will have next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to atlas texture(altas is single page, and will only one switch)</li>
                    <li>render <marker>rectangle.png</marker> texture from atlas as atlas texture region</li>
                    <li>render <marker>round.png</marker> texture from atlas as atlas texture region</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>using prerendered texture(using texture buffering):
        <ul>
            <li>once loaded atlas on initialization (can be used strait file access, but texture atlas is good point for using)</li>
            <li>once rendering into <marker>Frame Buffer Object</marker> will have next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to atlas texture(altas is single page, and will only one switch)</li>
                    <li>render into fbo <marker>rectangle.png</marker> texture atlas region</li>
                    <li>render into fbo <marker>round.png</marker> texture atlas region</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>every render loop will have next steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>switch to fbo texture(<marker>Frame Buffer Object</marker> include summary resulted texture, and will only one switch)</li>
                    <li>render fbo texture(or texture region of fbo texture,depend of your needs)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </li>
</ul>
<br> Using fbo looks like best solution, but fbo limited in max size, depend of hardware/software restrictions, and can be not safe, or hard for implement safe, with keep quality of picture close to original, for crossplatforming, if your resulted fbo texture size greater than 1024px(this size is supported on lot of devices even ancient which is not in production few years).
<br><br>Full background buffering using fbo , can be normal solution for game which not allow change screen size often, because f.e. if screen background textures is binded to right and left corner than you must full recreate fbo texture every moment when screen size was changed, to keep expected look, which is no needed when you use few textures prepared using separated small sized fbo instances, or texutre atlases.
